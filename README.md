## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a **Computer Science Engineering (CSE) student** who is currently focused on learning and building strong fundamentals in programming and problem-solving. I am not working in a company right now, but I actively build projects and improve my skills consistently.

Alongside programming, I run a **small creative venture** where I design **box and packaging designs**, which helps me combine creativity with real-world problem solving.

### 🔹 What I’m Learning
- **C Language** (Basic to Intermediate)
- **Python** (Foundations & practice)
- **C++ with Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**

### 🔹 What I’m Looking For
- Beginner-friendly **open-source contributions**
- **College-level and learning projects**
- Collaboration with like-minded developers

I believe in **consistency, clarity of fundamentals, and continuous improvement**.

I also enjoy **collecting GitHub achievements and badges**, as they motivate me to stay active, contribute genuinely, and improve my profile step by step. I am always open to **tips, guidance, and community support** to earn achievements through real learning and meaningful contributions.
